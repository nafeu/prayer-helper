بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ
الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ
الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ
مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ
إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ
اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ
صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ

**Transliteration:**
Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem
Alhamdu lillahi rabbil alameen
Ar-Rahmanir Raheem
Maliki yawmid deen
Iyyaka na'budu wa iyyaka nasta'een
Ihdinas siratal mustaqeem
Siratal latheena an'amta alayhim ghayril maghdoobi alayhim wa lad daleen

**English Translation:**
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds
The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Master of the Day of Judgment
You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help
Guide us to the straight path
The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have evoked anger or of those who are astray

**Significance:** Al-Fatiha is the most important surah in the Quran. It must be recited in every rakat of every prayer. The Prophet (peace be upon him) called it "The Mother of the Book" and "The Seven Oft-Repeated Verses." It establishes the fundamental relationship between the worshipper and Allah, acknowledging His sovereignty, seeking guidance, and recognizing the straight path.

And from the evil of an envier when he envies."

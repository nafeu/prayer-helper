I want to make an app called "prayer-helper" which is a simple HTML/CSS/JS-based mobile-render first web app which contains 4 tabs, meant to help muslims who are trying to make sure they follow proper prayer rituals. To keep editability simple, I would prefer that all of the tabs be written in markdown format and then interpolated (or built) into a single index.html file. You can set up whatever simple minimal build pipeline is necessary but try to keep the dependencies as simple as possible.

The 4 tabs should be as follows:

1. How To Pray
- a simple guide on the basics of performing salat (prayer) in the sunni-muslim way, this can be structured as a table or just as steps where each step includes instructions in english, the quranic arabic text along with transliteration and translation as well as a note for the "why" behind the ritual (giving some basic explanation as to where it is from and why). This should be done for all steps of prayer up until the final slaam

2. Surah Guide
- starting with surah fatiha, provide a table of a handful of short surahs that are great for day to day prayer, also include the english translation and maybe a summary of what/why this surah is significant and what it means

3. Pre-prayer Quiz
- a simple quiz refresher which asks you multiple choice questions about different aspects of prayer ie. what you do at certain parts of the rituals, what certain verses of surah's from the surah guide means, etc.

4. A breakdown of all prayers and how many sunnat, fard or witr rakats are required

Please also provide build instructions and running instructions, and finally, provide instructions as to how I can deploy this directly to github pages through my github url `nafeu.github.io` (which is linked to the custom domain nafeu.com, so the final URL to access the application can be `nafeu.com/prayer-helper`)
